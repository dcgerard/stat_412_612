# Relational Data

- Load the tidyverse

    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    ```


- Many datasets have more than two data frames.

- These data frames are often connected (rows in one correspond to rows in another)

- Consider the data in the nycflights13 package.
    ```{r}
    library(nycflights13)
    ```


    - `airlines`: Airline names.
        ```{r}
        data("airlines")
        head(airlines)
        ```
    
    - `airports`: Airport metadata
        ```{r}
        data("airports")
        head(airports)
        ```
        
    - `planes`: Plane metadata.
        ```{r}
        data("planes")
        head(planes)
        ```
        
    - `weather`: Hourly weather data
        ```{r}
        data("weather")
        head(weather)
        ```
        
    - `flights`: Flights data
        ```{r}
        data("flights")
        head(flights)
        ```
        
    ![](./relational-nycflights.png)\ 

- For nycflights13:

    - `flights` connects to `planes` via a single variable, `tailnum`.

    - `flights` connects to `airlines` through the `carrier` variable.

    - `flights` connects to `airports` in two ways: via the `origin` and `dest` variables.

    - `flights` connects to `weather` via `origin` (the location), and `year`, `month`, `day` and `hour` (the time).
    
- Variables used to connect a pair of data frames are called **keys**.

- **Primary key**: Identifies rows in its own table.

- **Foreign key**: Identifies rows in another table.

- *Example*: `planes$tailnum` is a primary key because it uniquely identifies rows in `planes`.

    ```{r}
    planes %>%
      group_by(tailnum) %>%
      count() %>%
      filter(n > 1)
    ```

- *Example*: `flights$tailnum` is a foreign key because it uniquely identifies rows in `planes`. There are multiple rows with the same `tailnum` in `flights`, so `flights$tailnum` is *not* a primary key.

    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      group_by(tailnum) %>%
      count() %>%
      filter(n > 1)
    ```

- *Example*: `weather$origin` is *part* of the primary key for `weather` (along with `year`, `month`, `day`, and `hour`) and a foreign key for `airports` (`weather$origin` is connected to `airports$faa`).


- If a table lacks a primary key (like `flights`) then you can add one with `mutate()` and `row_number()`.

    ```{r}
    flights %>%
      mutate(row = row_number()) %>%
      select(row, everything())
    ```


- **Exercise** ([RDS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) 13.3.1.2): Identify the primary 
  keys in the following data frames.

    - `Lahman::Batting`,
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    ## playerID, yearID, and stint
    Lahman::Batting %>%
      count(playerID, yearID, stint) %>%
      filter(n > 1)
    ```
    
    - `babynames::babynames`,
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    ## year, sex, and name
    babynames::babynames %>%
      count(year, sex, name) %>%
      filter(n > 1)
    ```
    
    - `nasaweather::atmos`,
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    ## lat, long, year, and month
    nasaweather::atmos %>%
      count(lat, long, year, month) %>%
      filter(n > 1)
    ```
    
    - `fueleconomy::vehicles`,
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    ## id
    fueleconomy::vehicles %>%
      count(id) %>%
      filter(n > 1)
    ```
    
    - `ggplot2::diamonds`.
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
    ## None
    nrow(ggplot2::diamonds)
    ggplot2::diamonds %>%
      distinct() %>%
      nrow()
    ```
    
    (You might need to install some packages and read some documentation.)

# Join Set-Up

- Suppose we have the following two data frames

    ![](./join-setup.png)\ 

    ```{r}
    x <- tribble(~key, ~val_x,
                 #---  ------
                 1,    "x1",
                 2,    "x2",
                 3,    "x3")
    y <- tribble(~key, ~val_y,
                 #---  ------
                 1,    "y1",
                 2,    "y2",
                 4,    "y3")
    ```


- A join connects rows of `x` to rows of `y`.

    ![](./join-setup2.png)\ 

- E.g. match row `1` of `x` with row `1` of `y`, and row `2` of `x` with row `2` of `y`.

    ![](./join-inner.png)\ 

# Inner Join

- `inner_join(x, y)` matches the rows of `x` with rows of `y` only when their keys are equal.

    ![](./join-inner.png)\

    ```{r}
    inner_join(x, y, by = join_by(key))
    ```
    
- Put the key you are joining by inside `join_by()`.

- Keeps all rows that appear in *both* data frames.


- **Exercise**: Select all flights that use a plane where you have some 
  annotation.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    inner_join(flights, planes, by = join_by(tailnum))
    ```



# Outer Join

- Keeps all rows that appear in *at least one* data frame.

    ![](./join-outer.png)\

- `left_join(x, y)` keeps all rows of `x`.
    ```{r}
    left_join(x, y, by = join_by(key))
    ```
    
- `left_join()` is by far the most common joiner, and you should always use this
  unless you have a good reason not to.
    
- `right_join(x, y)` keeps all rows of `y`.

    ```{r}
    right_join(x, y, by = join_by(key))
    ```

- `full_join(x, y)` keeps all rows of both.

    ```{r}
    full_join(x, y, by = join_by(key))
    ```
    

- **Exercise**: Add the full airline names to the `flights` data frame.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    left_join(flights, airlines, by = join_by(carrier)) %>%
      select(name, everything())
    ```
    

# Duplicate Keys

- If you have duplicate keys in one table, then the rows from the data frame
  where there is no duplication are copied multiple times in the new data frame.

    ![](./join-one-to-many.png)\ 
    
    (useful for adding summary data to a table)
    
    ```{r}
    x_mult <- tribble(~key, ~val_x,
                      ##--  ------
                      1,    "x1",
                      2,    "x2",
                      2,    "x3",
                      1,    "x4")
    
    left_join(x_mult, y, by = join_by(key))
    ```
    

- If you have duplicate keys in both (usually a mistake), then you get every 
  possible combination of the values in x and y at the key values where there
  are duplications. You'll get a warning about this.

    ![](./join-many-to-many.png)\
    
    ```{r}
    y_mult <- tribble(~key, ~val_y,
                      ##--  ------
                      1,    "y1",
                      2,    "y2",
                      2,    "y3",
                      1,    "y4")
    
    left_join(x_mult, y_mult, by = join_by(key))
    ```

- **Exercise**: In the previous two exercises, we had some duplicate keys. For
  each exercise, which data frame had the duplicate keys?
  
    ```{block, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    `flights` had the duplicate keys both times. We added the plane annotation to  each flight (where multiple flights used the same plane) in the first exercise  and we added the carrier name (where multiple flights used the same carrier) in the second exercise.
    ```
  
  
- **Exercise**: Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    library(hexbin)
    flights %>%
      select(tailnum, contains("delay")) %>%
      left_join(planes, by = join_by(tailnum)) %>%
      select(year, contains("delay")) %>%
      mutate(age = 2013 - year) ->
      subflight
    
    ggplot(subflight, aes(x = age, y = dep_delay)) +
      xlab("Age of Plane") +
      ylab("Depatrue Delay (min)") +
      geom_hex() +
      theme_bw() +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
      scale_fill_continuous(low = "grey90", high = "black")
    
    lm(dep_delay ~ age, data = subflight) %>%
      summary()
    
    ## Not adjusting for anything, it seems that each additional year older a plane
    ## is, is associated with a 6 second decrease in depature delay.
    
    ggplot(subflight, aes(x = age, y = arr_delay)) +
      xlab("Age of Plane") +
      ylab("Depatrue Delay (min)") +
      geom_hex() +
      theme_bw() +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
      scale_fill_continuous(low = "grey90", high = "black")
    
    lm(arr_delay ~ age, data = subflight) %>%
      summary()
    
    ## We got a similar finding with the arrival delay
    ```


# Filtering Joins

- `semi_join()` *keeps* all of the rows in `x` that have a match in `y` (but
  don't add the variables of `y` to `x`).
  
    ![](join-semi.png)\
  
    ```{r}
    semi_join(x, y, by = join_by(key))
    ```
    
- `anti_join()` *drops* all of the rows in `x` that have a match in `y` (but
  don't add the variables of `y` to `x`).
  
    ![](join-anti.png)\
  
    ```{r}
    anti_join(x, y, by = join_by(key))
    ```
  
- **Exercise**: Find the 10 days of the year that have the highest median 
  departure delay, then select all flights from those 10 days.
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    flights %>%
      group_by(year, month, day) %>%
      summarize(med_dep = median(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
      arrange(desc(med_dep)) %>%
      ungroup() %>%
      slice(1:10) ->
      ten_worst
    
    semi_join(flights, ten_worst)
    ```
  
# Other Key Names

- If the primary and foreign keys do not match, you need to specify that using a logical condition inside `join_by()`. E.g. `join_by(a == b)`, where `a` is the key in `x` and `b` is the key in `y`.

    ```{r}
    left_join(flights, airports, by = join_by(origin == faa))
    ```
    
- If you have multiple variables acting as the key, you just add those arguments in `join_by()`.

    ```{r}
    left_join(flights, weather, by = join_by(origin, year, month, day, hour))
    ```
