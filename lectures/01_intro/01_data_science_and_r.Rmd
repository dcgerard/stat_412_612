## Learning Objectives

- Introduction to Course

- Placing R in the context of data science.

- Chapter 1 in RDS

# Data Science

## Components of Data Science

- Statistics

- Domain Knowledge

- Computation

## Statistics

- Inferring general properties given data.

- Causal inference.

- Modeling (generative and predictive).

- Quantifying uncertainty.

- STAT 615 (Regression), STAT 627 (Machine Learning),
  most of the STAT curriculum.

## Domain Knowledge

- Expertise in an area of application.

- E.g. biology, psychology, economics, chemistry, etc...

- Allows you to understand data in context.

- Let's you ask interesting questions.

- Let's you spot problems with existing analysis pipelines.

- Various "Tracks" in the data science program.

## Computation -- This class

- Data gathering.

- Data preparation.

- Data exploration.

- Data transformation.

- Data visualization.

- STAT 612 (R programming), STAT 613 (Data Science), most of the CS curriculum.

# Various Professions

## What makes a data scientist?

- Lots of professions use those three skills to analyze data.

- My (very subjective) opinion is that these professions differ by their level
  of expertise.

## Scientist

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
namevec <- c("Computation", "Statistics", "Domain\nKnowledge")
skillvec <- c(0.2, 0.2, 1)
qplot(namevec, skillvec, geom = "blank") +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Skill") +
  ylab("Level of Expertise") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  ylim(0, 1)
```

## Statistician

```{r, echo=FALSE}
skillvec <- c(0.2, 1, 0.2)
qplot(namevec, skillvec, geom = "blank") +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Skill") +
  ylab("Level of Expertise") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  ylim(0, 1)
```

## Computer Scientist

```{r, echo=FALSE}
skillvec <- c(1, 0.2, 0.2)
qplot(namevec, skillvec, geom = "blank") +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Skill") +
  ylab("Level of Expertise") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  ylim(0, 1)
```

## Data Scientist

```{r, echo=FALSE}
skillvec <- rep(1.4/3, 3)
qplot(namevec, skillvec, geom = "blank") +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Skill") +
  ylab("Level of Expertise") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  ylim(0, 1)
```


# The steps of an analysis and R

## Steps of a data analysis

![](./figures/data-science.png)\ 

## Tools

- Many tools exist for these steps:

- General data tools: R, Python, Julia, Matlab, STATA, SAS

- Other tools: SQL (data import), git (version control), map/reduce software
  (for big data).
  
- Advantages and disadvantages to each.

## R

- R is a statistical scripting language.

- You write code (a series of commands) to perform some task.

- R can be used to perform **all** of the tasks of a data analysis.

## Motivation for R

1. It's free. 
    - You will always have access to R. 
    - Not true for other statistical softwares (Matlab, STATA, SAS).
\pause
2. It's widely used. 
    - If you  need to do some special analysis, someone has probably already made an R package for it. 
    - Just use Google to check.
\pause
3. It's easy (especially graphics and data munging).

## Motivation for R

4. It makes reproducible research easy. 
    - When part of the pipeline is copying and pasting excel spreadsheets, people make mistakes. 
    - E.g. an [\textcolor{blue}{excel mistake}](https://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_301-350/WP322.pdf) led countries to adopt austerity measures to increase economic growth.
    - E.g. an [\textcolor{blue}{excel mistake}](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/how-excel-may-have-caused-loss-of-16000-covid-tests-in-england) resulted in a backlog of misplaced COVID tests in England.
    - In R, you can automate your analysis, reducing the chance for mistakes and making your analysis transparent to the wider research community.

## Could Also Learn Python

- Python is also a very good tool for data science. 

- Computer scientists tend to prefer it because its syntax is more like a 
  standard computer language. But I think this makes it harder to learn for
  a non-programmer.
  
- Main reason to use either tool is based on what your collaborators use.

## Two main flavors of R

- There are two flavors of R programmers: Base R users and tidyverse users.

- Base R is more general (not fighting against the system when you want to 
  accomplish a unique task that isn't designed to fit within the tidyverse).
  
- tidyverse is much more convenient for the vast majority of tasks as long as 
  you drink the kool aid.

## Grading

- Assignments: 40% for grad students, 50% for undergrads

- 2 midterms: 12% each

- Final exam: 16%

- Grad students: Final Project: 20%

- Undergrads: Attendance/participation: 10%

## Exams

- The exams will be in-class coding assignments. You will have 2.5 hours to
  complete some coding questions.

## Curve

- No curve for individual assignments/exams/projects.

- Curve your overall grade at the end of the semester.

- Curve the median up to 85%.

- Usual cutoffs for A/A-/B+/B/B-/C+/C/C-/D/F.

- My classes usually finish with the pre-curve median being around 75%.

## One last note

- The course notes will **not** contain everything you need for the assignments.

- You will need to use Google. Just make sure you understand any support you get
  and cite your sources.

- This is how most people learn how to code now.
